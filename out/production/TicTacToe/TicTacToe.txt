In this diagram, Main is the entry point of the program and creates instances of the other classes. Main interacts with Player to create players for the game.

The Player class represents a player and interacts with Move to make moves during the game. It can also communicate with Board to check the current state of the board.

The Move class represents a move made by a player and is created and used by the Player class.

The Board class manages the game board and can be used by both Player and TicTacToeStrategy to check the current state of the board.

The TicTacToeStrategy class represents a strategy for playing Tic Tac Toe. It uses the Board class to analyze the current state of the board and make informed decisions about the next move.

This diagram demonstrates the relationships between the classes and how they interact with each other to implement the game logic.
